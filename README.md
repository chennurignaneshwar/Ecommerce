This project titled “Interactive E-Commerce Frontend Prototype Using JavaScript” is developed as part of 
internship in website development. The aim of this project is to build a functional and visually appealing e
commerce web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, 
and view the total price dynamically. The entire project emphasizes client-side development techniques and 
demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic rendering with vanilla JavaScript. The 
final result is a responsive and interactive shopping experience prototype suitable for showcasing frontend web 
development skills.. 

# Objectives 
• To design and develop a responsive e-commerce frontend interface. 
• To implement dynamic product display using JavaScript arrays and DOM manipulation. 
• To provide a working “Add to Cart” system with real-time updates and total price calculation. 
• To demonstrate core web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without backend 
integration. 
• To gain hands-on experience in building real-world web user interfaces. 
# Outcomes 
Upon successful completion of the internship, : 
• - A fully functional single-page frontend e-commerce prototype. 
• Dynamic product rendering using JavaScript and seamless DOM updates. 
• An interactive cart module that updates in real-time and calculates the total. 
• Improved understanding of layout structuring with HTML/CSS and interactivity through JavaScript. 
• Development of clean, maintainable code and basic UI/UX practices for web apps. 


# Conclusion 
The e-commerce frontend prototype successfully meets the intended objectives by delivering an interactive user 
interface with basic shopping functionalities. Through this project, key concepts of JavaScript such as array 
manipulation, event handling, and local DOM updates were effectively applied. The project not only enhanced 
technical proficiency but also provided a clear understanding of how modern e-commerce interfaces are 
structured at the frontend level. This prototype can be extended further by integrating backend features or using 
libraries like React for a full-stack experience.
